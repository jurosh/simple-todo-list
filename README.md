# OFFICIAL REQUIREMENTS

Thank you for signing up for the final project of the React Native Academy.

For reference, all course materials are available here:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vAttwTatHsu5pCkzBp5U4XkwGMtstKzzEU8WJADaGZE/edit?usp=sharing

The testing period is Friday 9th March to Friday 30th March.

Here is the project description.

**Write a mobile ToDo list application**

* User must be able to create an account and log in.
* User should be able to CRUD ToDo lists.
* The list should have a title, unlimited number of entries, and allow attachments, like images and people.
* User can filter saved lists by their name.
* Images can be attached either by accessing user photo library or by taking photos using a camera.
* People can be attached accessing the Contacts list.
* Lists should be shareable thought the Share interface.
* REST API. Make it possible to perform all user actions via the API, including authentication. If you do not know how to create your own backend you can use Firebase.com or similar services to create the API.
* Minimal UI/UX design is needed. You will not be marked by graphic design. However, do try to keep it as tidy as possible.

You will need to create a Github or Bitbucket repository for your project, and send us the link before the end of the testing period. We will email again and/or post in #react-native-academy on Slack towards the end of the testing period on where to submit your repositories. After the deadline, we will check all the repositories and then send the invitation to schedule an interview with one of the screeners to all candidates that have non-empty repositories.

Good luck!
